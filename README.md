# Files Shuffle ðŸ”€ Scripts

This script shuffles all files in a folder.

## Usage

This script shuffles files in a single folder. For instance, we have **1.mp3**, **2.mp4**, **3.png**. After shuffling, we will have **1.mp3** with the content from **2.mp4**, and the file has the wrong extension. Similarly, **2.mp4** now is **3.png** content and can't be opened, and so on.

## Benefits

- Easy shuffle files.
- Gain an easy ability to change a game's asset very quickly.
- And more, based on your usage.

*Notices: Do not use this script to destroy someone's project and throw it publicly.*
